## Concept blocks

### Generative AI

`"generative AI" OR "large language model*" OR LLM OR ChatGPT OR GPT-4 OR "AI tutor*" OR "AI companion*"`

### Learning intervention

`learn* OR teach* OR tutor* OR instruction OR feedback OR scaffold* OR practice OR education OR student*`

### Outcomes distinguishing learning from performance

`retention OR transfer OR "independent performance" OR "unaided performance" OR posttest OR "post-test" OR delayed OR achievement OR "learning outcome*" OR dependency OR overreliance`

### Comparative design filter for the causal subset

`random* OR trial OR experiment* OR control* OR compar* OR "difference-in-differences" OR regression`

## Seed combined query

```text
("generative AI" OR "large language model*" OR ChatGPT OR GPT-4 OR "AI tutor*")
AND (learn* OR tutor* OR instruction OR feedback OR scaffold* OR practice)
AND (retention OR transfer OR unaided OR independent OR posttest OR delayed OR "learning outcome*")
```

Do not apply the comparative filter to the broad scoping search; use it for a narrower causal map.

## Sources to search

- ERIC
- PsycINFO
- Scopus or Web of Science
- Education Source
- ACM Digital Library
- IEEE Xplore
- PubMed where relevant
- arXiv for clearly labelled emerging preprints
- backward and forward citation chains around [S001], [S002], and [S003]
- trial registries and institutional working-paper series for publication-bias signals

Google Scholar and web search are discovery aids, not the reproducible database search.

## 2026-08-31 targeted update

- Native web query: `2025 2026 randomized controlled trial generative AI learning later unaided assessment retention students`
- arXiv/publisher resolution: *Experimental Evidence on the Learning Impact of Generative AI*, arXiv:2607.08849v1
- Decision: include as [S015] after full-text methods/results inspection because it randomizes AI access and measures both immediate and approximately one-week unaided outcomes.
- Boundary: this targeted update does not complete the reproducible database search or publication-bias assessment. The queue item remains active.

## Required search log

For every database: platform, full query, filters, date searched, result count, export filename, and deduplication count. Store citation metadata in Zotero and screening decisions in `screening.csv`.
